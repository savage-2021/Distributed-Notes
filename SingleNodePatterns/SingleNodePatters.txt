Motivations 
    - Goals behind containerisation 
        -> Establishes boundaries around specific resources 
        -> The boundary describes team ownership 
        -> The boundary gives separation of concerns 
        -> Theese are the reasons for splitting an application on a single machine into a group of containers 
    - Splitting onto separate machines pros 
        -> Scaling 
        -> Separation of concenrs 
        -> easy to update, understand, and redeploy
